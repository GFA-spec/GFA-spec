# Graphical Fragment Assembly (GFA) Format Specification

We are developing [the specification of the Graphical Fragment Assembly (GFA) format](GFA-spec.md). Your contribution is welcome. Please open up issues or submit pull requests. 

The format was first suggested in a [blog post](http://lh3.github.io/2014/07/19/a-proposal-of-the-grapical-fragment-assembly-format/) by Heng Li (@lh3) and further developed in a [second post](http://lh3.github.io/2014/07/23/first-update-on-gfa/).
